# Communication models
class Message(Base):
    __tablename__ = "messages"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    sender_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    content = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    message_type = Column(Enum(MessageType))
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    edited_at = Column(DateTime)
    parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("messages.id"))  # For replies

class MessageRecipient(Base):
    __tablename__ = "message_recipients"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    message_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("messages.id"))
    recipient_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    read_at = Column(DateTime)
    is_deleted = Column(Boolean, default=False)

class Announcement(Base):
    __tablename__ = "announcements"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    content = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    activity_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id"))
    author_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    priority = Column(Enum(Priority), default=Priority.NORMAL)
    expires_at = Column(DateTime)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
