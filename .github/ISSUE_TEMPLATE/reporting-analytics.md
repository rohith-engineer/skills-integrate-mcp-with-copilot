## Overview
Create comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to provide insights into activity participation, student engagement, and program effectiveness.

## Current State
- No reporting capabilities
- No data visualization
- No analytics or insights
- No export functionality

## Proposed Implementation
- [ ] Create analytics data models
- [ ] Implement reporting dashboard
- [ ] Add data visualization components
- [ ] Create exportable reports
- [ ] Add real-time analytics
- [ ] Implement custom report builder
- [ ] Add automated report scheduling
- [ ] Create performance metrics

## Technical Details
```python
# Analytics models
class ActivityReport(Base):
    __tablename__ = "activity_reports"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    report_type = Column(Enum(ReportType))
    parameters = Column(JSON)  # Report parameters
    created_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    last_run = Column(DateTime)

class AnalyticsMetric(Base):
    __tablename__ = "analytics_metrics"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    metric_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    metric_value = Column(Float)
    metric_date = Column(Date)
    activity_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id"))
    category = Column(String)
```

## Report Types to Implement
### Participation Reports
- [ ] **Activity Enrollment**: Current enrollment numbers per activity
- [ ] **Participation Trends**: Enrollment trends over time
- [ ] **Student Activity**: Individual student participation history
- [ ] **Capacity Utilization**: How full activities are vs. capacity
- [ ] **Waitlist Reports**: Students waiting for popular activities

### Performance Analytics
- [ ] **Completion Rates**: Activity completion statistics
- [ ] **Attendance Analytics**: Session attendance patterns
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Student progress across activities
- [ ] **Achievement Reports**: Milestone and badge completion
- [ ] **Engagement Metrics**: Student engagement indicators

### Administrative Reports
- [ ] **Resource Utilization**: Facility and equipment usage
- [ ] **Staff Workload**: Teacher/supervisor activity loads
- [ ] **Financial Reports**: Activity costs and budget tracking
- [ ] **Demographics**: Student participation by grade/group
- [ ] **Safety Reports**: Incident tracking and safety metrics

## Dashboard Features
### Executive Dashboard
- [ ] **Key Metrics**: High-level participation numbers
- [ ] **Trend Charts**: Enrollment and participation trends
- [ ] **Alerts**: Important notifications and warnings
- [ ] **Quick Stats**: At-a-glance performance indicators

### Teacher Dashboard
- [ ] **My Activities**: Activities I supervise
- [ ] **Student Progress**: Progress in my activities
- [ ] **Attendance**: Attendance tracking and patterns
- [ ] **Communications**: Messages and announcements

### Student Dashboard
- [ ] **My Progress**: Personal activity progress
- [ ] **Achievements**: Badges and certificates earned
- [ ] **Schedule**: Upcoming activities and events
- [ ] **Goals**: Personal and activity goals

## Visualization Components
- [ ] **Charts**: Line, bar, pie charts for data visualization
- [ ] **Tables**: Sortable, filterable data tables
- [ ] **Calendars**: Activity and event calendars
- [ ] **Progress Bars**: Visual progress indicators
- [ ] **Heatmaps**: Activity popularity and timing
- [ ] **Geographic Maps**: Location-based analytics (if applicable)

## Export Capabilities
- [ ] **PDF Reports**: Formatted PDF reports
- [ ] **Excel Export**: Spreadsheet-compatible data
- [ ] **CSV Export**: Raw data for further analysis
- [ ] **Email Reports**: Automated email delivery
- [ ] **API Access**: Programmatic access to data

## API Endpoints
- `GET /reports/activities` - Activity participation reports
- `GET /reports/students/{id}` - Individual student reports
- `GET /analytics/metrics` - Key performance metrics
- `POST /reports/custom` - Generate custom report
- `GET /reports/{id}/export` - Export report in various formats

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive dashboards for different user roles
- [ ] Data visualizations are clear and informative
- [ ] Reports can be customized and filtered
- [ ] Data can be exported in multiple formats
- [ ] Real-time data updates in dashboards
- [ ] Performance metrics provide actionable insights
- [ ] Reports are accessible and mobile-friendly
- [ ] Automated reports can be scheduled

## Priority
**Medium** - Valuable for data-driven decisions

## Dependencies
- User authentication system
- Database integration
- Activity progress tracking
- Calendar system

## Estimated Effort
Large (5-6 days)
