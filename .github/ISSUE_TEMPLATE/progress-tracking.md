## Overview
Add comprehensive tracking system to monitor student progress, completion status, and achievements within extracurricular activities.

## Current State
- No progress tracking beyond enrollment
- No completion status or milestones
- No achievement system
- No performance metrics

## Proposed Implementation
- [ ] Create progress tracking data models
- [ ] Implement milestone and achievement system
- [ ] Add progress reporting dashboard
- [ ] Create attendance tracking
- [ ] Implement skill/competency tracking
- [ ] Add progress notifications
- [ ] Create completion certificates
- [ ] Add progress analytics

## Technical Details
```python
# Progress tracking models
class ActivityProgress(Base):
    __tablename__ = "activity_progress"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    activity_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id"))
    status = Column(Enum(ProgressStatus))
    progress_percentage = Column(Float, default=0.0)
    started_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    completed_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    
class Milestone(Base):
    __tablename__ = "milestones"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    activity_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id"))
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    description = Column(Text)
    order_index = Column(Integer)
    points = Column(Integer, default=0)

class UserMilestone(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user_milestones"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    milestone_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("milestones.id"))
    completed_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    notes = Column(Text)
```

## Features to Implement
### Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Enrollment Status**: Active, completed, dropped
- [ ] **Attendance Rate**: Track session attendance
- [ ] **Milestone Progress**: Break activities into achievable goals
- [ ] **Skill Development**: Track specific skills gained
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Participation quality indicators

### Achievement System
- [ ] **Badges**: Visual rewards for achievements
- [ ] **Certificates**: Completion certificates
- [ ] **Leaderboards**: Friendly competition (optional)
- [ ] **Progress Portfolios**: Student achievement portfolios

### Reporting
- [ ] **Student Dashboard**: Personal progress overview
- [ ] **Teacher Dashboard**: Monitor student progress
- [ ] **Parent Portal**: View child's progress
- [ ] **Analytics**: Participation and completion trends

## User Stories
- As a **student**, I want to see my progress in activities I'm enrolled in
- As a **teacher**, I want to track and update student progress
- As a **parent**, I want to view my child's activity participation
- As an **administrator**, I want analytics on activity effectiveness

## API Endpoints
- `GET /users/{id}/progress` - Get user's activity progress
- `PUT /activities/{id}/progress/{user_id}` - Update progress
- `POST /activities/{id}/milestones` - Create milestone
- `PUT /milestones/{id}/complete/{user_id}` - Mark milestone complete
- `GET /activities/{id}/analytics` - Get activity analytics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Students can view their progress in enrolled activities
- [ ] Teachers can update student progress and milestones
- [ ] Progress is visualized with charts and indicators
- [ ] Completion certificates are generated automatically
- [ ] Attendance tracking is integrated with progress
- [ ] Analytics provide insights into activity effectiveness
- [ ] Progress data can be exported for records

## Priority
**Medium** - Valuable for engagement and accountability

## Dependencies
- User authentication system
- Database integration
- Calendar system (for attendance)

## Estimated Effort
Large (4-5 days)
