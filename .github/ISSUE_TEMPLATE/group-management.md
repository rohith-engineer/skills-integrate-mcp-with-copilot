## Overview
Add sophisticated group and team management capabilities to organize students within activities and facilitate collaboration.

## Current State
- All activity participants are in one flat list
- No sub-groups or teams within activities
- No group-based permissions or features
- No collaborative tools

## Proposed Implementation
- [ ] Create group/team data models
- [ ] Implement group creation and management
- [ ] Add group-based permissions
- [ ] Create team collaboration features
- [ ] Implement group messaging/communication
- [ ] Add group progress tracking
- [ ] Create group assignment tools
- [ ] Add group size limits and auto-balancing

## Technical Details
```python
# Group management models
class Group(Base):
    __tablename__ = "groups"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    description = Column(Text)
    activity_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id"))
    max_members = Column(Integer, default=None)
    created_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

class GroupMembership(Base):
    __tablename__ = "group_memberships"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    group_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("groups.id"))
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    role = Column(Enum(GroupRole), default=GroupRole.MEMBER)
    joined_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

class GroupRole(Enum):
    LEADER = "leader"
    MEMBER = "member"
    ASSISTANT = "assistant"
```

## Features to Implement
### Group Management
- [ ] **Group Creation**: Teachers can create groups within activities
- [ ] **Auto-Assignment**: Automatically balance groups by skill/preference
- [ ] **Manual Assignment**: Teachers can manually assign students
- [ ] **Self-Selection**: Students can choose their own groups
- [ ] **Group Limits**: Set maximum/minimum group sizes

### Group Features
- [ ] **Group Profiles**: Each group has a profile page
- [ ] **Group Projects**: Assign projects to groups
- [ ] **Group Progress**: Track progress at group level
- [ ] **Group Resources**: Shared files and resources
- [ ] **Group Calendar**: Group-specific events and meetings

### Collaboration Tools
- [ ] **Group Messaging**: Internal group communication
- [ ] **File Sharing**: Share documents within groups
- [ ] **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to group members
- [ ] **Group Notes**: Collaborative note-taking
- [ ] **Meeting Scheduler**: Schedule group meetings

## User Stories
- As a **teacher**, I want to create balanced groups for collaborative activities
- As a **student**, I want to communicate with my group members
- As a **group leader**, I want to assign tasks to group members
- As a **student**, I want to see my group's progress and upcoming tasks

## API Endpoints
- `POST /activities/{id}/groups` - Create group in activity
- `POST /groups/{id}/members` - Add member to group
- `GET /groups/{id}/members` - Get group members
- `PUT /groups/{id}/members/{user_id}/role` - Update member role
- `GET /groups/{id}/progress` - Get group progress
- `POST /groups/{id}/messages` - Send group message

## UI Components
- [ ] Group creation wizard
- [ ] Group member list with roles
- [ ] Group communication panel
- [ ] Group progress dashboard
- [ ] Group assignment interface

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Teachers can create and manage groups within activities
- [ ] Students can be assigned to groups automatically or manually
- [ ] Group members can communicate within their groups
- [ ] Group progress is tracked separately from individual progress
- [ ] Group leaders have additional permissions for their groups
- [ ] Groups can be reorganized as needed
- [ ] Group collaboration tools are intuitive and useful

## Priority
**Medium** - Enhances collaborative learning

## Dependencies
- User authentication system
- Database integration
- Activity progress tracking

## Estimated Effort
Medium-Large (4-5 days)
