## Epic Overview
Transform the current simple extracurricular activity signup system into a comprehensive activity management platform inspired by features found in educational platforms like Moodle and Open edX.

## Current State
Our application currently provides:
- Basic activity listing with descriptions and schedules
- Simple email-based signup/unregister functionality
- In-memory data storage
- Basic web interface

## Vision
Create a robust platform that provides:
- Secure user authentication and role-based access
- Persistent data storage with proper database integration
- Calendar and event management
- Progress tracking and completion analytics
- Group and team collaboration tools
- Communication and messaging capabilities
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

## Epic Goals
1. **Security & User Management**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. **Data Persistence**: Move from in-memory to database storage
3. **Enhanced UX**: Provide calendar views and better user interfaces
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor student engagement and completion
5. **Collaboration**: Enable group work and team activities
6. **Communication**: Facilitate interaction between participants
7. **Analytics**: Provide insights for data-driven decisions

## Related Issues
This epic consists of the following feature implementations:

### Phase 1 - Foundation (High Priority)

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 5-6 days (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 13-15 days (Core Features)
- **Phase 3**: 10-12 days (Advanced Features)
- **Total**: ~30 days for complete transformation

## Dependencies
Issues should be completed in order due to dependencies:
1. Database integration must be completed before authentication
2. Authentication must be completed before other features
3. Calendar and progress tracking enable group management
4. All core features enable advanced reporting and communication

## Notes
