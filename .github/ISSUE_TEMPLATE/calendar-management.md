## Overview
Implement a comprehensive calendar system to manage activity schedules, events, and provide better time management for students and staff.

## Current State
- Activities have basic schedule text
- No visual calendar representation
- No conflict detection
- No event management capabilities

## Proposed Implementation
- [ ] Create calendar data models
- [ ] Add event creation and management
- [ ] Implement calendar view UI component
- [ ] Add recurring event support
- [ ] Implement schedule conflict detection
- [ ] Add event notifications and reminders
- [ ] Create calendar permissions system
- [ ] Add event attendance tracking

## Technical Details
```python
# Calendar models
class Event(Base):
    __tablename__ = "events"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    description = Column(Text)
    start_datetime = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)
    end_datetime = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)
    activity_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id"))
    created_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    is_recurring = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    recurrence_pattern = Column(String)  # JSON field
    location = Column(String)

class EventAttendance(Base):
    __tablename__ = "event_attendance"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    event_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("events.id"))
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    status = Column(Enum(AttendanceStatus))
    marked_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

## Features to Implement
- [ ] **Calendar Views**: Monthly, weekly, daily views
- [ ] **Event Creation**: Teachers can create events for their activities
- [ ] **Recurring Events**: Support for weekly/monthly recurring activities
- [ ] **Conflict Detection**: Prevent scheduling conflicts
- [ ] **Event Registration**: Students can register for specific events
- [ ] **Attendance Tracking**: Mark attendance for events
- [ ] **Notifications**: Email/in-app reminders for upcoming events
- [ ] **Calendar Export**: iCal/Google Calendar integration

## UI Components
- [ ] Calendar grid component
- [ ] Event creation modal
- [ ] Event details view
- [ ] Attendance marking interface
- [ ] Calendar filters and search

## API Endpoints
- `GET /calendar/events` - Get events for date range
- `POST /events` - Create new event
- `PUT /events/{id}` - Update event
- `DELETE /events/{id}` - Delete event
- `POST /events/{id}/attend` - Mark attendance
- `GET /events/{id}/attendance` - Get attendance list

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can view activities in calendar format
- [ ] Teachers can create and manage events
- [ ] Students can see their enrolled activities on calendar
- [ ] Conflict detection prevents double-booking
- [ ] Attendance can be tracked for events
- [ ] Calendar is responsive and mobile-friendly
- [ ] Events can be exported to external calendars

## Priority
**Medium** - Significant UX improvement

## Dependencies
- User authentication system
- Database integration

## Estimated Effort
Large (5-6 days)
