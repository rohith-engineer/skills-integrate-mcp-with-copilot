## Overview
Add a comprehensive user authentication system with role-based access control to secure the application and provide different capabilities for students, teachers, and administrators.

## Current State
- No user authentication (anyone can sign up/remove anyone)
- No user roles or permissions
- Activities use email addresses without validation

## Proposed Implementation
- [ ] Add user registration and login system
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication
- [ ] Create user roles (Student, Teacher, Administrator)
- [ ] Add permission-based access control
- [ ] Create user profile management
- [ ] Add password hashing and security
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add password reset functionality

## Technical Details
```python
# User model structure
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = Column(String, nullable=False)
    first_name = Column(String)
    last_name = Column(String)
    role = Column(Enum(UserRole), default=UserRole.STUDENT)
    is_active = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

class UserRole(Enum):
    STUDENT = "student"
    TEACHER = "teacher"
    ADMINISTRATOR = "administrator"
```

## User Stories
- As a **student**, I want to log in to view and sign up for activities
- As a **teacher**, I want to manage activities I supervise
- As an **administrator**, I want to manage all activities and users

## API Endpoints to Add
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info
- `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /auth/reset-password` - Password reset

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register and login securely
- [ ] Passwords are properly hashed
- [ ] JWT tokens are used for authentication
- [ ] Role-based permissions work correctly
- [ ] Only authenticated users can modify activities
- [ ] Users can only modify their own enrollments (students)
- [ ] Teachers can manage their assigned activities
- [ ] Administrators have full access

## Priority
**High** - Required for security and proper user management

## Dependencies
- Requires database integration to be completed first

## Estimated Effort
Large (4-5 days)
